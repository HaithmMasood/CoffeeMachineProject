# Coffee Machine Simulator

## Project Description
This project simulates a virtual coffee machine using Java. It progresses through several stages, each adding more complexity and features. The simulation includes basic coffee-making processes, ingredient calculations, resource management, transaction processing, and state management through object-oriented programming.

## Stages
1. **Making Coffee**: Simulates the basic steps of making a cup of coffee.
2. **Ingredient Calculator**: Calculates the required ingredients based on the desired number of coffee cups.
3. **Estimate the Number of Servings**: Checks if the machine has enough resources for the requested number of cups.
4. **Buy, Fill, Take**: Simulates buying coffee, refilling ingredients, and managing money.
5. **Keep Track of the Supplies**: Enhances the machine to perform multiple actions and track resources.
6. **Brush up Your Code**: Refactors the program into a class structure for improved management and scalability.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the `src/` directory.
- Compile the program using `javac CoffeeMachine.java`.
- Run the program using `java CoffeeMachine`.

## Features
- Interactive command-line interface to simulate coffee making and machine management.
- Multiple coffee types including espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Realistic ingredient and resource management.
- Money management feature for transactions.
